# Subtask Execution Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for enhancing the IndieFuture Agent CLI's ability to execute subtasks autonomously after the initial task decomposition. The current system successfully decomposes tasks into subtasks but struggles with their actual execution.

## Core Execution Framework

### 1. Subtask Execution Manager
- Create a new component (`SubtaskExecutor`) responsible for orchestrating the execution of subtasks
- Maintain execution state tracking for each subtask (Pending, InProgress, Completed, Failed)
- Implement priority queue for task scheduling based on dependencies and importance

### 2. Tool Integration Framework
- Develop a pluggable tool system that allows the agent to interact with external systems
- Create a standard interface for all tools: `trait Tool { fn execute(&self, args: &ToolArgs) -> Result<ToolOutput, Error>; }`
- Implement core tools:
  - CodeSearchTool: Search codebase for relevant information
  - CodeModificationTool: Make changes to code files
  - DocumentationTool: Generate and update documentation
  - BashExecutionTool: Execute bash commands with proper security measures
  - CommandExecutionTool: Run shell commands and capture outputs
  - WebSearchTool: Perform limited web searches for relevant information

### 3. Context Management
- Enhance the memory system to maintain context between subtasks
- Implement a "working memory" to store intermediate results and insights
- Create a context object that passes relevant information from completed subtasks to dependent ones

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
1. Develop the `SubtaskExecutor` structure in `src/task/executor.rs`
2. Create basic tool interfaces and registry in a new `src/tools/` directory
3. Implement context management in `src/memory/working_context.rs`

### Phase 2: Tool Implementation
1. Build the CodeSearchTool utilizing existing codebase parsing capability
2. Implement CommandExecutionTool with proper sandboxing and security measures
3. Create DocumentationTool for generating markdown and other documentation formats
4. Develop basic CodeModificationTool with safeguards and validation

### Phase 3: Integration and Orchestration
1. Connect the task decomposition system to the subtask execution system
2. Implement dependency resolution for subtasks
3. Add progress tracking and reporting
4. Create rollback capabilities for failed subtasks

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add learning mechanisms to improve subtask execution over time
2. Implement parallel execution for independent subtasks
3. Create execution strategies based on task types
4. Add user feedback loops for critical decisions

## Execution Flow

1. User inputs a high-level task
2. Task Decomposer breaks it into subtasks (existing functionality)
3. SubtaskExecutor analyzes the subtasks and determines execution order
4. For each subtask:
   - Determine required tools and context
   - Execute the subtask using appropriate tools
   - Capture results and update the working context
   - Mark subtask as completed or failed
   - Update dependent subtasks with new information
5. Report overall progress to the user
6. Present final results with summary of actions taken

## Technical Implementation Details

### Subtask Representation
```rust
struct Subtask {
    id: String,
    description: String,
    status: SubtaskStatus,
    dependencies: Vec<String>, // IDs of dependent subtasks
    required_tools: Vec<ToolType>,
    execution_plan: ExecutionPlan,
    result: Option<SubtaskResult>,
}

enum SubtaskStatus {
    Pending,
    InProgress,
    Completed,
    Failed(String), // Error message
}

struct SubtaskResult {
    output: String,
    artifacts: HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>,
    context_updates: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

### Tool System
```rust
trait Tool {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    fn execute(&self, args: &ToolArgs) -> Result<ToolOutput, Error>;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> Vec<Capability>;
}

struct ToolArgs {
    command: String,
    parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
    context: SharedContext,
}

struct ToolOutput {
    success: bool,
    result: Value,
    message: Option<String>,
    artifacts: HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>,
}
```

### Execution Context
```rust
struct SharedContext {
    variables: HashMap<String, Value>,
    artifacts: HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>,
    history: Vec<ContextEvent>,
    metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}

struct ContextEvent {
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    event_type: EventType,
    description: String,
    data: Option<Value>,
}
```

## Integration with AI Models

- Enhance prompt templates to include execution context and prior subtask results
- Create specialized prompts for different types of subtasks
- Implement feedback loops to refine execution based on previous results
- Add capability for the AI to suggest refinements to the execution plan

## Security Considerations

- Implement strict permission controls for file modifications
- Create sandboxed environment for command execution
- Add validation checks before making any changes to the codebase
- Create an approval system for high-risk operations
- Log all actions taken by the agent for audit purposes

## User Experience Enhancements

- Add detailed progress reporting during subtask execution
- Create interactive mode for subtasks requiring user input
- Implement explainability features to help users understand agent decisions
- Add visualization of subtask dependencies and execution flow

## Shell Execution Capabilities

### Importance of Bash Integration

Shell command execution is a critical capability for autonomous agent operation, particularly for development-related tasks. Many subtasks in software development, system administration, and data analysis require shell commands to be executed. The IndieFuture Agent CLI must have robust Bash integration for the following reasons:

1. **Development Workflow Integration**: Most development workflows rely heavily on command-line tools for building, testing, and deploying code. The agent must be able to execute these commands to be truly useful.

2. **System Interaction**: Many tasks require interacting with the operating system through shell commands - managing files, installing dependencies, running services, etc.

3. **Tool Orchestration**: Software development relies on numerous CLI tools (git, npm, cargo, docker, etc.) that must be accessible to the agent.

4. **Data Processing**: Shell commands provide powerful ways to process, filter, and transform data.

5. **Automation Capabilities**: Most automation scripts in development environments are shell-based.

### Bash Execution Tool Implementation

The `BashExecutionTool` will be implemented with the following features:

```rust
struct BashExecutionTool {
    allowed_commands: HashSet<String>,
    sandbox_config: SandboxConfig,
    environment: HashMap<String, String>,
    working_directory: PathBuf,
}

impl Tool for BashExecutionTool {
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "bash"
    }
    
    fn description(&self) -> &str {
        "Executes bash commands in a controlled environment"
    }
    
    fn execute(&self, args: &ToolArgs) -> Result<ToolOutput, Error> {
        // Validate command against security policies
        // Set up sandbox environment
        // Execute command
        // Capture and process output
        // Return structured results
    }
    
    fn capabilities(&self) -> Vec<Capability> {
        vec![
            Capability::ExecuteCommand,
            Capability::FileSystemAccess,
            Capability::ProcessManagement,
        ]
    }
}
```

### Security Measures for Bash Execution

1. **Command Allowlisting**: Only approved commands and their parameters will be allowed.
   
2. **Sandboxed Execution**: Commands will run in a sandboxed environment with controlled access to resources.
   
3. **Resource Limitations**: CPU, memory, and time constraints will be enforced for each command.
   
4. **Output Validation**: Command outputs will be validated and sanitized before being processed.
   
5. **Audit Logging**: All commands and their outputs will be logged for security review.
   
6. **User Approval**: High-risk commands will require explicit user approval before execution.

### Integration with Subtask System

The Bash execution capability will be tightly integrated with the subtask system:

1. Subtasks can specify bash commands as part of their execution plan.
   
2. The SubtaskExecutor will validate these commands against security policies.
   
3. Command outputs will be captured and stored in the shared context for other subtasks to use.
   
4. Failed commands will trigger appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.
   
5. The agent will be able to generate bash commands based on subtask requirements using AI prompting.

### Context Persistence

To maintain state across bash command executions:

1. Environment variables will be preserved between command executions.
   
2. Working directory state will be maintained.
   
3. Command outputs will be stored in the shared context.
   
4. Temporary files and artifacts will be managed by the agent.

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of subtasks successfully executed without human intervention
- Accuracy of code modifications and documentation generation
- Execution time compared to manual task completion
- User satisfaction with autonomous execution capabilities
- Error rate and recovery capabilities
- Number of shell commands successfully executed without errors
- Percentage of tasks requiring shell commands that were completed autonomously
- Security incident rate related to shell command execution

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing the IndieFuture Agent CLI with robust subtask execution capabilities, allowing it to operate with greater autonomy and effectiveness. The addition of secure Bash execution capabilities is particularly crucial for enabling the agent to perform a wide range of software development tasks that would otherwise require human intervention.
